# FSPM - File Server Permissions Manager
Main plans:
- Minimalist GUI to manage permissions on file servers/shares/directories/etc.
- Powershell Module to use all available functions
- Maybe a console application as well?
  - May not do this, just because I plan to have PS Module...

Functionality:
- Set permissions structure on a location
- Save/load permissions structure from XML file.
- Intelligently view current permissions structure of a location
  - This will probably be a feature that will be in on-going development
- More to come?
